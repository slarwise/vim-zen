# Vim-zen

Removes distractions and lets you focus on the text, similarly to vim goyo. With
vim-zen you get the full text height which you can't currently in vim goyo.

## Installation

Use your preferred installation method for Vim plugins. With vim-plug you would
write the following in your vimrc.

```
call plug#begin('~/.vim/plugged')
    Plug 'slarwise/vim-zen'
call plug#end()
```

## Setup
